\title{Polyclass: polychotomous regression and multiple classification}
\description{Probability or classification plots for a  \code{\link{polyclass}} model.  }
\usage{\method{plot}{polyclass}(x, cov, which, lims, what, data, n, xlab="", ylab="",
zlab="", ...) }
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{polyclass} object, typically the result of \code{\link{polyclass}}. }
\item{cov}{
a vector of length \code{fit\$ncov}, indicating for which combination of  
covariates the plot should be made. Can never be omitted. Should always have 
length \code{fit\$ncov}, even if some values are irrelevant.  }
\item{which}{
for which covariates should the plot be made.  
Number or a character string defining the name, if the 
same names were used with the call to \code{\link{polyclass}}. Which should have length one if 
\code{what} is 6 or larger and length two if \code{what} is 5 or smaller.  }
\item{lims}{plotting limits. If omitted, the plot is made over the same range 
of the covariate as in the original data. Otherwise a vector of 
length two of the form \code{c(min, max)} if what is 6 or larger and a vector of 
length four of the form \code{c(xmin, xmax, ymin ,ymax)} if \code{what} is 5 or smaller.  }
\item{what}{
an integer between 1 and 8, defining the type of plot to be made. 
\enumerate{
\item Plots the probability of one class as a contour plot of two variables. 
\item Plots the probability of one class as a perspective plot of two variables. 
\item Plots the probability of one class as an image plot of two variables. 
\item Classifies the area as a contour plot of two variables. 
\item Classifies the area as an image plot of two variables. 
\item Classifies the line as a plot of one variable. 
\item Plots the probabilities of all classes as a function of one variable. 
\item Plots the probability of one class as a function of one variable. 
}
}
\item{data}{Class for which the plot is made. Should be provided if \code{what} is 1, 2, 3 or 8.  }
\item{n}{
the number of equally spaced points at which to plot the fit. The 
default is 250 if \code{what} is 6 or larger or 50 (which results in 2500 plotting 
points) if \code{what} is 5 or smaller. 
}
\item{xlab,ylab,zlab}{axis plotting labels.}
\item{...}{
all other options are passed on.  }
