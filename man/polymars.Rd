\usage{polymars(responses, predictors, maxsize, gcv = 4, additive = FALSE, 
startmodel, weights, no.interact, knots, knot.space = 3, ts.resp, 
ts.pred, ts.weights, classify, factors, tolerance, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{responses}{vector of responses, or a matrix for multiple response regression. 
In the case of a matrix each column corresponds to a response and each 
row corresponds to an observation. Missing values are not allowed. 
}
\item{predictors}{matrix of predictor variables for the regression. Each column corresponds to a 
predictor and each row corresponds to an observation in the same order as 
they appear in the response argument. Missing values are not allowed. 
}
\item{maxsize}{the maximum number of basis functions that the model is allowed to grow to in 
the stepwise addition procedure. Default is 
\eqn{\min(6*(n^{1/3}),n/4,100)}, where \code{n} is the number of observations. 
}
\item{gcv}{parameter used to find the overall best model from a sequence of fitted models. 
The residual sum of squares of a model is penalized by dividing by the square of   
\code{1-(gcv x model size)/cases}.   
A larger gcv value would tend to produce a smaller model.
Models for which \code{1-(gcv x model size)/cases} is smaller or equal than 0 are
never selected.
}
\item{additive}{Should the fitted model be additive in the predictors? 
}
\item{startmodel}{the first model that is to be fit by \code{polymars}. It is either an 
object of the class \code{polymars} or a model dreamed up by the user.
 In that case, 
it takes the form of a \code{4 x n} matrix, where 
\code{n} is the  number of basis functions in the starting model excluding
the intercept. Each row corresponds to one basis 
function (with two possible components). Column 1 is the index of the first 
predictor involved. Column 2 is a possible knot in this predictor. If column 
2 is \code{NA}, the first component is linear. Column 3 is the possible second 
predictor involved (if column 3 is \code{NA} the basis function only depends on one 
predictor). Column 4 contains the possible knot for the predictor in column 3, 
and it is \code{NA} when this component is linear.  Example: if a row reads 
\code{3 NA 2 4.7}, the corresponding basis function is \eqn{[X_3 * (X_2-4.7)_+]}; if a row 
reads \code{2 4.3 NA NA} the corresponding basis function is \eqn{[(X_2-4.3)_+]}. 
A fifth column can be added with 1s and 0s, The 1s specify which basis 
functions of the startmodel must be in each model. Thus, these 
functions stay in the model during the whole stepwise fitting procedure. 
If \code{startmodel} is not specified \code{polymars} starts with a model that only contains  
the intercept. 
}
\item{weights}{optional vector of observation weights; if supplied, the algorithm fits to minimize the 
sum of the weights multiplied by the squared residuals.  The length of 
weights must be the same as the number of observations. The weights must 
be nonnegative. 
}
\item{no.interact}{an optional matrix used if certain predictor interactions are not allowed in the model. 
It is given as a matrix of size \code{2 x m}, with predictor indices as entries.  The two 
predictors of any row cannot have interaction terms with each other. 
}
\item{knots}{defines how the function is to find potential knots for the spline basis 
functions.  This can be set to the maximum number of knots you would 
like to be considered for each predictor. 
Usually, to avoid the design matrix becoming singular the actual number of 
knots produced is constrained to at most every third order statistic in any 
predictor. This constraint can be adjusted using the \code{knot.space} argument. 
It can also 
be a vector with the number of potential knots for each predictor. 
Again the actual number of knots produced is constrained to be at most every 
third order statistic any predictor.  
A third possibility is to provide a matrix where each columns corresponds 
to the ordered knots you would like to have considered for that predictor. 
This matrix should be filled out to a rectangular data structure with NAs. 
The default is \code{min(20, round(n/4))} knots per predictor. 
When specifying knots as a vector an entry of \code{-1} indicates that the predictor  
is a categorical variable and each unique entry in it's column is treated as a  
level. 
  
When specifying knots as a single number or a matrix and there are categorical  
variables these are specified separately as such using the factor argument. 
}
\item{knot.space}{
is an integer describing the minimum number of order statistics apart that 
two knots can be. Knots should not be too close to insure numerical stability. 
}
\item{ts.resp}{
testset responses for model selection. Should have the same number of columns 
as the training set response. A testset can be used for the model selection. 
Depending on the value of classify, either the model with the smallest testset 
residual sum of squares or the smallest testset classification error is 
provided.  Overrides \code{gcv}. 
}
\item{ts.pred}{
testset predictors. Should have the same number of columns 
as the training set predictors. 
}
\item{ts.weights}{
testset observation weights. A vector of length equal to the number of cases 
of the testset. All weights must be non-negative. 
}
\item{classify}{
when the response is discrete (categorical), polymars can be used for 
classification. In particular, when \code{classify = TRUE}, a discrete response 
with \code{K} levels is replaced by \code{K} indicator variables as response. Model 
selection is still being carried out using gcv, except when a testset is 
provided, in which case testset misclassification is used to select the best 
model. 
}
\item{factors}{
used to indicate that certain variables in the predictor set are categorical  
variables. Specified as a vector containing the appropriate predictor  
indices (column numbers of categorical variables in predictors matrix). Factors  
can also be set when the \code{knots} argument is given as a vector, with 
\code{-1} as  
the appropriate entries for factors. 
}
\item{tolerance}{
for each possible candidate to be added/deleted the resulting residual sums  
of squares of the model, with/without this candidate, must be calculated.  
The inversion of of the "X-transpose by X" matrix, X being the design matrix,  
is done by an updating procedure c.f. C.R. Rao - Linear Statistical Inference  
and Its Applications, 2nd. edition, page 33.   
In the inversion the size of the bottom right-hand entry of this matrix is  
critical. If it\code{s value is near zero or the value of it}s inverse is   
almost zero then the  
inversion procedure becomes somewhat inaccurate. The lower the tolerance value the  
more careful the procedure is in selecting candidates for addition to the model  
but it may exclude too conservatively. And the other hand if the tolerance is set 
too high a spurious result with a singular or otherwise sub-optimal model may  
occur. By default tolerance is set to 1.0e-5. 
}
\item{verbose}{
when set  to \code{TRUE}, the function will print out a line for each addition or deletion  
stage. For example, " + 8 : 5 3.25 2 NA" means adding interaction basis function  
of predictor 5 with knot at 3.25 and predictor 2 (linear), 
to make a model of size 8, including intercept. 
}
}
\value{
An object of the class \link{polymars}.
The returned object contains information about the fitting steps and the model 
selected. The first data frame contains a row for each step of the fitting 
procedure. In the columns are: a 1 for an addition step or a 0 for a deletion 
step, the size of the model at each step, residual sums of squares (RSS) and  
the generalized cross validation value (GCV), testset residual sums of squares 
or testset misclassification, whatever was used for the model selection. 
The second data frame, model, contains a row for each basis function of the 
model. Each row corresponds to one basis 
function (with two possible components). The pred1 column contains the indices 
of the first predictor of the basis function. Column knot1 is a possible knot  
in this predictor. If this column is NA, the first component is linear. If  
any of the basis functions of the model is categorical then there will be a  
level1 column. Column pred2 is the possible second predictor involved (if  
it is NA the basis function only depends on one  
predictor). Column knot2 contains the possible knot for the predictor pred2,  
and it is NA when this component is linear. This is a similar format  
to the startmodel argument together with an additional first row corresponding to the  
intercept but the startmodel doesn't use a separate column to specify levels of a  
categorical variable . If any predictor in pred2 is categorical then there will be a level2  
column. The column "coefs" (more than one column in the case of multiple response  
regression) contains the coefficients. 
The returned object also contains the fitted values and residuals of the data used 
in fitting the model. 
}
\note{The algorithm employed by \code{polymars} is different from the MARS(tm)
algorithm of Friedman (1991), though it has many similarities. (The name
\code{polymars} has been used for this algorithm well before MARS was trademarked.)
Some of the main differences are:

\code{polymars} requires linear terms of a predictor to be in the model
before nonlinear terms using the same predictor can be added;

\code{polymars} requires a univariate basis function to be in the model
before a tensor-product basis function involving the univariate
basis function can be in the model;

during stepwise deletion the same hierarchy is maintained;

\code{polymars} can be fit to multiple outcomes simultaneously, with
categorical outcomes it can be used for multiple classification; and

\code{\link{polyclass}} uses the same modeling strategy as \code{polymars},
but uses a logistic (polychotomous) likelihood.
